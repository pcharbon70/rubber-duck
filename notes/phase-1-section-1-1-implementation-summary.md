mix test test/rubber_duck/agents/user_agent_test.exs

# Start an interactive session
iex -S mix

# Create a UserAgent instance
{:ok, agent} = RubberDuck.Agents.UserAgent.create_for_user("user123")

# Record user activity
{:ok, updated_agent} = RubberDuck.Agents.UserAgent.record_activity(agent, :code_analysis, %{file: "test.ex"})

# Get suggestions
{:ok, suggestions} = RubberDuck.Agents.UserAgent.get_suggestions(updated_agent)
```

## Architecture Insights

### 1. Jido Framework Learning
- Jido provides excellent separation of concerns between Agents, Skills, and Actions
- Agent configuration requires careful schema definition and proper metadata
- Skills provide powerful modularity with state isolation
- Actions enable composable workflows with validation

### 2. Integration Strategy
- Bridging existing Ash resources with agent intelligence is straightforward
- Skills can wrap existing business logic while adding learning capabilities
- Agent state can be backed by Ash resources for persistence

### 3. Learning System Design
- Pattern recognition enables meaningful behavioral adaptation
- Confidence scoring provides reliable decision support
- Experience tracking creates foundation for continuous improvement

## Conclusion

Phase 1 Section 1.1 implementation has successfully established the foundational agentic architecture with the Jido SDK. The LearningSkill and UserAgent provide a solid foundation for autonomous, learning behaviors. With 25% completion on core agents and 60% on skills architecture, the project is progressing well toward the goal of creating autonomous, self-managing agents.

The next phase of work should focus on completing the remaining domain agents (ProjectAgent, CodeFileAgent, AIAnalysisAgent) and building comprehensive integration tests to validate the multi-agent coordination capabilities.
