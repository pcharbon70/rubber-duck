# Phase 1 Section 1.6: Integration Tests - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 1 Section 1.6 represents the culmination of the entire Phase 1 Agentic Foundation, providing comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete system working together as a cohesive, autonomous agent ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

With all individual components of Phase 1 implemented (Sections 1.1-1.5), we need to ensure that:

- All components work together seamlessly in production scenarios

## Solution Overview

Create a comprehensive integration test suite that validates the entire Phase 1 foundation working as an integrated system, focusing on real-world scenarios and cross-component interactions.
