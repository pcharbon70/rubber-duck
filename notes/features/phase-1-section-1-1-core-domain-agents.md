# Feature Planning: Phase 1 Section 1.1 - Core Domain Agents with Skills Architecture

## Problem Statement

The RubberDuck application currently relies on traditional Phoenix/OTP patterns and lacks the autonomous, self-managing architecture required for an intelligent coding assistant. Phase 1.1 aims to establish the foundational agentic layer by implementing four core domain agents (UserAgent, ProjectAgent, CodeFileAgent, AIAnalysisAgent) using the Jido SDK's Skills, Instructions, and Directives architecture.

### Impact Analysis

**Current State Issues:**
- No autonomous agent system for managing user interactions, projects, code files, or AI analysis
- Lacks self-learning and adaptive behaviors for improving assistance quality
- Missing proactive capabilities for anticipating user needs
- No modular skill-based architecture for extensible agent capabilities
- Limited integration between existing Ash Framework domain resources and intelligent behaviors

**Expected Impact:**
- **High**: Enables autonomous, self-managing agents that learn and adapt
- **High**: Provides foundation for all subsequent agentic functionality phases
- **Medium**: Reduces manual configuration and improves user experience through proactive assistance
- **Medium**: Creates reusable Skills architecture for community extensibility

## Solution Overview

Transform the application from traditional MVC patterns to an agent-based architecture where each domain (User, Project, CodeFile, AIAnalysis) is managed by an autonomous agent capable of:

1. **Learning from interactions** and improving assistance quality over time
2. **Proactive behavior** such as suggesting optimizations, detecting issues, predicting needs
3. **Self-organization** through dynamic capability addition/removal via Skills and Directives
4. **Autonomous communication** between agents to coordinate complex workflows

### Design Decisions

**Architecture Pattern:** Domain-driven agent design with Skills-based capabilities
- Each agent focuses on a specific domain but can leverage shared Skills
- Skills provide modular, reusable capabilities that can be composed dynamically
- Directives enable runtime behavior modification without restart

**Integration Strategy:** Bridge existing Ash resources with agentic interfaces
- Preserve existing Ash authentication and database layers
- Add agentic intelligence layer on top of proven Ash patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility with current API patterns

**Technology Stack:**
- **Agent Framework:** Jido SDK for agent infrastructure
- **State Management:** Jido Agent state with Ash resource backing
- **Skills System:** Jido Skills for modular capabilities
- **Actions:** Jido Actions for discrete operations
- **Communication:** Jido Signals for inter-agent messaging

## Research Conducted

### Jido SDK Analysis

**Key Findings:**
1. **Agents:** Built on OTP GenServer, provide stateful processes with lifecycle management
2. **Skills:** Modular capability packages with routing, state isolation, and configuration
3. **Actions:** Self-contained, validated, composable units of functionality
4. **Instructions:** Workflow composition patterns for complex behavior chains
5. **Directives:** Runtime behavior modification without process restart

**Integration Patterns:**
- Agents can be configured with multiple Skills for mixed capabilities
- Skills provide state namespace isolation preventing interference
- Actions support compensation logic for error handling
- Instructions enable dynamic workflow composition

### Existing Codebase Analysis

**Ash Framework Resources:**
- User authentication via `RubberDuck.Accounts.User`
- Token management via `RubberDuck.Accounts.Token` and `RubberDuck.Accounts.ApiKey`
- Database layer via `RubberDuck.Repo` with PostgreSQL
- No existing project or code file domain models (will need creation)

**Application Structure:**
- Standard Phoenix application with Ash authentication
- Oban for background job processing
- Phoenix PubSub for message passing
- Current supervision tree ready for agent integration

**Dependencies Status:**
- Jido SDK not yet added to mix.exs (needs addition)
- All other required infrastructure (Ash, Phoenix, Oban) already present

- **Issue:** Agent state backup and restore might become complex with skills
- **Mitigation:** Use Ash resources for persistent state with agent state caching
- **Testing:** Test agent restart scenarios with various state configurations

### Architecture Considerations

**Scalability Concerns:**
- Each agent runs as separate GenServer process
- Skills share agent process but maintain isolated state namespaces
- Signal routing scales with Phoenix PubSub distributed capabilities
- Database operations leverage Ash framework optimizations

**Security Implications:**
- Agents inherit security context from Ash authentication system
- Skills have access to agent state but cannot modify other skills
- Action execution validates permissions before state changes
- Agent communication secured through PubSub topic permissions

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Skills registry needs periodic cleanup of unused skills
- Learning data requires archival strategy for long-term storage
- Agent logs need structured format for debugging complex interactions
- Performance metrics collection for optimization identification
