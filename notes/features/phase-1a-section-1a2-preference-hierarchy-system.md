# Phase 1A Section 1A.2: Preference Hierarchy System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement the preference hierarchy resolution engine and project override management system. This builds on the Ash persistence layer from 1A.1 to provide runtime preference resolution with caching, inheritance, and override capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. PreferenceResolver Module
- Core resolution logic implementing three-tier hierarchy (System → User → Project)
- ETS-based caching for performance
- Batch resolution for efficiency
- Graceful handling of missing preferences

### 2. Inheritance System
- Track preference sources across the hierarchy
- Selective override mechanism preserving inheritance
- Category-level inheritance support
- Debug capabilities for troubleshooting

### 3. Cache Management
- In-memory ETS cache for resolved preferences
- Cache invalidation on preference changes
- Cache warming strategies for commonly accessed preferences
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### 4. Preference Watchers
- Phoenix.PubSub for real-time preference change notifications
- Callback system for reactive updates
- Subscription management for interested processes
- Integration with existing agent systems

### 5. Project Override Management
- Toggle system for enabling/disabling project overrides
- Partial override support maintaining inheritance
- Override validation ensuring compatibility and permissions
- Analytics for tracking usage patterns and optimization

```

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each module with comprehensive edge cases
- Integration tests for the complete resolution workflow
- Performance tests for cache efficiency
- Concurrent access tests for ETS operations
- Real-time update tests for preference watchers

## Dependencies

- Existing Ash preference resources from 1A.1
- Phoenix.PubSub for change notifications
- ETS for high-performance caching
- Jason for JSON preference value handling

## Success Criteria

- Three-tier preference resolution working correctly
- Cache providing significant performance improvement
- Real-time preference updates propagating properly
- Project overrides functioning with proper validation
- All Credo issues resolved
- Project compiles without warnings
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Implementation Notes

- Prefer ETS over GenServer state for cache to avoid bottlenecks
- Use Phoenix.PubSub for loose coupling of preference watchers
- Implement graceful degradation when cache is unavailable
- Ensure thread safety for concurrent preference access
- Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
