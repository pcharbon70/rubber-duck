# Feature: Phase 1A Section 1A.10 Security & Authorization

## Problem Statement
- **Current State**: The RubberDuck project has a comprehensive preference management system (sections 1A.1-1A.9) with basic authentication agents and skills, but lacks comprehensive security controls for preference access and data protection.
- **Business Impact**: Without proper RBAC, encryption, audit logging, and approval workflows, sensitive user preferences and API keys are at risk. The system cannot meet enterprise security requirements or compliance standards.
- **User Need**: Users and organizations need role-based access control for preferences, secure storage of sensitive configuration data, comprehensive audit trails, and delegation/approval workflows for sensitive changes.

## Solution Overview
- **Approach**: Implement comprehensive security layer using Ash Framework's authorization system with RBAC policies, encryption for sensitive preferences, comprehensive audit logging, and workflow-based approval systems.
- **Key Design Decisions**: 
  - Use Ash.Policy.Authorizer for declarative access control
  - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
  - Create workflow-based approval system using agents for complex security decisions
  - Build comprehensive audit system that tracks all preference changes and access
- **Integration Points**: Deep integration with existing preference resources, authentication agents, and permission agents while maintaining backward compatibility.

  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/security_policy.ex` - Security policy resource
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/audit_log.ex` - Audit log resource  
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/permission_delegation.ex` - Delegation resource
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/approval_request.ex` - Approval workflow resource
  - Test files for all security components

- **Files to Modify**:
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences.ex` - Add new security resources to domain
  - All existing preference resources - Add authorization policies and sensitive data encryption
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/user_preference.ex` - Add security policies
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/project_preference.ex` - Add security policies
  - `lib/rubber_duck/preferences/resources/system_default.ex` - Add security policies
  - CLI and API files - Add security validation

- **Dependencies**: 
  - No new external dependencies (uses existing ash_authentication, ash_postgres)
  - Leverage existing Jido agents for workflow automation
  - Use Phoenix's encryption capabilities for sensitive data

- **Database Changes**:
  - New tables: security_policies, audit_logs, permission_delegations, approval_requests
  - Add encrypted_value fields to existing preference tables
  - Add security metadata columns to existing preference tables

## Success Criteria
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - RBAC system prevents unauthorized preference access/modification
  - Sensitive preferences (API keys) are encrypted at rest and in transit
  - All preference changes are logged with complete audit trail
  - Approval workflow system works for sensitive preference changes
  - Permission delegation system enables temporary access grants
  - Security monitoring detects and alerts on suspicious activities

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Authorization checks add < 50ms to preference operations
  - Encryption/decryption of sensitive fields < 100ms
  - Audit logging is asynchronous and doesn't block operations
  - Security monitoring processes events in real-time

- **Quality Requirements**:
  - 100% test coverage for all security components
  - Security penetration testing passes
  - Compliance with data protection standards (GDPR considerations)
  - No sensitive data exposed in logs or error messages

## Agent Consultations Performed
- **research-agent**: [TO BE CONSULTED] - Research encryption best practices, GDPR compliance, audit logging standards
- **elixir-expert**: [TO BE CONSULTED] - Ash Framework authorization patterns, Phoenix encryption, security middleware
- **senior-engineer-reviewer**: [TO BE CONSULTED] - Security architecture, scalability of RBAC system, workflow design

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: 
  - Encryption key management complexity
  - Performance impact of comprehensive authorization checks
  - Complex workflow state management
  - Integration complexity with existing agents

- **Integration Risks**:
  - Breaking changes to existing preference APIs
  - Authentication integration complexities  
  - Agent coordination for approval workflows
  - CLI/API backward compatibility

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Phased rollout with feature flags
  - Comprehensive testing at each phase
  - Expert consultation for complex security decisions
  - Gradual migration with backward compatibility
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
  - Security audit at each milestone

## Notes
This feature builds on the comprehensive preference management system implemented in sections 1A.1-1A.9 and integrates with existing authentication and permission agents. The security layer is designed to be comprehensive yet maintainable, with proper separation of concerns and clear audit trails.

Key architectural decisions:
1. Use Ash Framework's declarative policy system for consistent authorization
2. Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data rather than full-table encryption
3. Use asynchronous audit logging to avoid performance impact
4. Leverage existing Jido agents for workflow automation and monitoring
5. Design for enterprise compliance while maintaining usability

The implementation follows the project's patterns of using Ash resources, Jido agents, and declarative configuration while adding robust security controls.
