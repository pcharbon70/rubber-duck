# Feature: Phase 1A Section 1A.11 Migration & Export System

## Problem Statement
- **Current State**: RubberDuck has basic preference migration infrastructure with PreferenceMigrationAgent and CLI utilities, but lacks comprehensive schema migration management, export/import capabilities, and systematic backup/restore functionality
- **Business Impact**: Users need robust data migration when preference schemas evolve, reliable backup/restore for disaster recovery, and export/import for sharing configurations across teams and environments
- **User Need**: Comprehensive migration system that handles schema evolution, data transformations, and seamless preference portability with zero data loss

## Solution Overview
- **Approach**: Build comprehensive migration and export system on top of existing PreferenceMigrationAgent, leveraging Ash Framework's migration patterns and PostgreSQL capabilities
- **Key Design Decisions**: 
  - Extend existing migration agent rather than replace to maintain backward compatibility
  - Use versioned schema migrations with automated rollback capabilities
  - Implement pluggable export/import formats (JSON, YAML, binary) with encryption support
  - Build sharing system with access controls and version management
- **Integration Points**: Extends existing preference management system (1A.1-1A.10), integrates with security layer for encrypted exports, hooks into CLI and web interfaces

## Agent Consultations Performed

### Research Agent Consultation
- **Topic**: Data migration patterns for Elixir applications, schema evolution, and export/import systems
- **Findings**: 
  - Ecto migrations provide robust transaction-based schema changes with automatic locking
  - Modern migration patterns support multiple migration paths for deployment flexibility
  - Schema versioning and rollback capabilities are critical for zero-downtime deployments
  - PostgreSQL backup/restore operations integrate well with application-level data management

### Ash Framework Research  
- **Topic**: Ash Framework migration patterns and data layer integration
- **Findings**:
  - Ash provides automated migration generation via `mix ash.codegen` for resource changes
  - Framework builds on Ecto rather than replacing it, allowing standard PostgreSQL operations
  - Integration with existing projects is supported incrementally
  - Built-in database lifecycle management with create/drop capabilities

### Architectural Consultation Needed
- **senior-engineer-reviewer**: Review architectural decisions for large-scale migration system
- **elixir-expert**: Validate Ash Framework integration patterns and performance considerations
- **security-expert**: Review encryption and access control patterns for export/sharing system

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Schema migration complexity**: Large preference datasets may cause migration timeouts
  - Mitigation: Implement chunked migrations with progress tracking
- **Data integrity during migration**: Risk of preference corruption during complex transformations
  - Mitigation: Mandatory backup before migration with integrity verification
- **Export/import security**: Sensitive preference data exposure during transfer
  - Mitigation: Mandatory encryption for exports with secure key management

### Integration Risks
- **Existing system compatibility**: Changes to migration agent may affect current workflows
  - Mitigation: Backward compatibility layer and gradual feature rollout
- **Performance impact**: Large export operations may impact system responsiveness
  - Mitigation: Background job processing with rate limiting and progress indication

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive backup before any migration operation
- Staged rollout with feature flags for new migration capabilities
- Performance monitoring and automatic scaling for export/import operations
- Encrypted audit trails for all data movement operations
- Emergency rollback procedures with automated data restoration
