- **Consistent security model** across all preference resources

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Security-First Design
- **Defense in depth** with multiple security layers
- **Principle of least privilege** in all authorization policies

- **Comprehensive logging** for security forensics and compliance

### Performance Optimized
- **Asynchronous audit logging** to avoid blocking operations
- **Batch processing** for high-throughput audit events
- **Memory management** with queue limits and automatic cleanup
- **Efficient authorization** with cached policy evaluation

### Enterprise Ready
- **RBAC system** supporting complex organizational structures
- **Approval workflows** for sensitive operations
- **Audit compliance** with comprehensive logging
- **Encryption standards** for sensitive data protection
