# Enhancing LLM-Based Coding Assistants: Techniques and Applications in Elixir

This document explores the most effective techniques used today in real-world LLM-assisted code generation systems, compares their effectiveness, and suggests how these ideas can be applied using the Elixir programming language and BEAM ecosystem.

---

## Overview of Key Techniques

| Technique                     | Description | Reported Gains |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT)       | Prompts LLMs to reason step-by-step. | +13.8% pass@1 (Structured CoT) |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | Supplies relevant code/docs as extra context. | +3x improvement in pass@1 |
| Iterative Self-Correction    | LLM revises output after test or error feedback. | From 53.8% to 81.8% accuracy |
| Agentic Workflows            | Multi-step planning with tools, memory, actions. | +2–20% across tasks |

---

## 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps LLMs plan their steps. A “structured” CoT approach asks the model to list helper functions or outline the logic before code generation. For example:

```elixir
"Let's think step-by-step. First, what helper functions do we need? Then, write each before the main function."
```

Reported impact:

- Structured CoT improved pass@1 by 13.8% over standard CoT.
- Helps break complex coding into smaller logical units.

---

## 2. Retrieval and Indexing (RAG)

Instead of relying solely on prompt memory, tools can query a code/document index to retrieve useful context before generation. This can include:

- Module documentation
- Related functions
- Usage patterns

Reported impact:

- EvoR framework improved pass@1 from 8.6% to 35.3%.
- ARCS showed higher correctness and faster convergence.

Elixir Implementation:

- Use `pgvector` + Ash or Ecto for vector search.
- Embed code/docs with OpenAI, Mistral, or local model.
- Store vectors in PostgreSQL for retrieval.

---

## 3. Iterative Self-Correction

LLMs generate code → run tests → use results to improve. These agents might:

- Run unit tests and re-prompt on failure.
- Lint code and summarize issues for the LLM.
- Use error messages in prompt refinement.

Reported impact:

- 53.8% → 81.8% correctness with test/review cycle.
- RethinkMCTS used test-guided search to go from 70% → 89%.

Elixir Implementation:

- Use Oban jobs for test execution.
- Stream test results to agent via PubSub.
- Prompt engine retries generation with feedback.

---

## 4. Agentic Multi-Step Workflows

Agents combine LLMs, tool use, memory, and planning. Examples:

- Tool use: run, test, search
- Memory: short/long-term recall
- Planning: outline → code → test → fix

Frameworks like DSPy, LangChain, and smol-agents support this.

Elixir Implementation:

- Use GenServers for agent tools.
- Use Reactor for DAG logic.
- Spark DSL to define agent plans.
- LangChain (Elixir) for LLM calls.

---

## 5. Open-Source Tools: Aider & OpenCode

### Aider

- GPT-powered CLI code assistant.
- Git integration, test auto-run, context-aware.
- Supports Claude, GPT, local models.

### OpenCode

- TUI with multi-model support.
- Works offline or with API LLMs.
- Agent-driven code editing via terminal.

---

## 6. BEAM-Friendly Considerations

Elixir is ideal for:

- Supervising multi-agent trees (OTP)
- Streaming context/results (Phoenix PubSub)
- Fault-tolerant memory + background jobs (Oban, GenServer)

Tools to build with:

- LangChain Elixir (LLM adapters)
- Ash Framework (agent modules)
- pgvector (memory storage)
- Phoenix Channels (client comms)

---

## Summary of Effectiveness

| Technique                  | Example Tool     | Impact                            |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chain-of-Thought          | DSPy             | +13.8% pass@1                     |
| RAG                       | EvoR, ARCS       | 3–4x improvement in correctness   |
| Iterative Correction      | CodeAgent        | +28% accuracy                     |
| Agentic Planning          | smol-agents, Aider | +5–20% on multi-step tasks       |

These techniques combine to form powerful assistants that reason, retrieve, refine, and remember.

# Integrating LLM Enhancement Techniques into RubberDuck: A Comprehensive Implementation Strategy

Integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT), RAG, Iterative Self-Correction, and Agentic Workflows into RubberDuck using a hybrid architecture that leverages Elixir's OTP principles, Spark DSL for engine-level abstractions, and Reactor DAGs for workflow orchestration. Start with CoT as a foundational technique implemented through functional composition patterns and behavior-based extensibility, enabling incremental addition of other enhancement techniques through a pluggable architecture.

The research reveals that Elixir's actor model and functional programming paradigms provide unique advantages for implementing these LLM enhancement techniques. The BEAM VM's built-in concurrency, fault tolerance, and supervision trees align naturally with the distributed, stateful nature of advanced LLM systems. By combining engine-level abstractions using Spark DSL with workflow-level orchestration through Reactor DAGs, RubberDuck can achieve both compile-time safety and runtime flexibility.

## Chain-of-Thought as the foundation technique

Chain-of-Thought prompting should be implemented as the cornerstone enhancement technique, providing a reusable pattern for structured reasoning across different LLM engines. The architecture leverages Elixir's functional composition and OTP patterns to create a robust, scalable CoT system.

### Core CoT architecture using Spark DSL

The implementation uses Spark DSL to create an expressive configuration language for defining reasoning chains:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.CoT.Dsl do
  use Spark.Dsl.Extension,
    sections: [@cot_section, @steps_section, @engines_section],
    transformers: [
      RubberDuck.CoT.Transformers.ValidateSteps,
      RubberDuck.CoT.Transformers.GenerateExecutor
    ]
    
  @cot_section %Spark.Dsl.Section{
    name: :cot,
    describe: "Chain-of-Thought configuration",
    entities: [
      %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
        name: :reasoning_chain,
        target: RubberDuck.CoT.ReasoningChain,
        args: [:name],
        schema: [
          name: [type: :atom, required: true],
          template: [type: :atom, default: :default],
          max_iterations: [type: :integer, default: 5]
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
end
```

This DSL approach provides compile-time validation while maintaining flexibility for different reasoning patterns. Developers can define domain-specific reasoning chains that are validated at compile time but executed dynamically.

### Multi-engine abstraction layer

A behavior-based system ensures CoT works consistently across different LLM providers:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Engine.Behaviour do
  @callback execute_prompt(prompt :: String.t(), opts :: keyword()) :: 
    {:ok, String.t()} | {:error, term()}
  @callback supports_streaming?() :: boolean()
  @callback max_context_length() :: integer()
end

defmodule RubberDuck.Engine.Registry do
  use GenServer
  
  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  def get_engine(name) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get, name})
  end
  
  def init(_opts) do
    engines = %{
      openai: RubberDuck.Engine.OpenAI,
      anthropic: RubberDuck.Engine.Anthropic,
      local: RubberDuck.Engine.Ollama
    }
    {:ok, engines}
  end
end
```

### State management with OTP

Using GenServer for managing conversation state ensures fault tolerance and enables distributed CoT processing:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.CoT.ConversationManager do
  use GenServer
  
  defstruct [:conversation_id, :chain_history, :current_context, :engine]
  
  def execute_chain(conversation_id, chain_config) do
    GenServer.call(via_tuple(conversation_id), {:execute_chain, chain_config})
  end
  
  def handle_call({:execute_chain, chain_config}, _from, state) do
    case execute_cot_chain(chain_config, state) do
      {:ok, result, new_state} ->
        {:reply, {:ok, result}, new_state}
      {:error, _} = error ->
        {:reply, error, state}
    end
  end
  
  defp via_tuple(conversation_id) do
    {:via, Registry, {RubberDuck.CoT.ConversationRegistry, conversation_id}}
  end
end
```

## Incremental technique integration through abstractions

The architecture supports adding enhancement techniques incrementally through a plugin-based system that maintains separation of concerns while enabling technique composition.

### Plugin architecture for extensibility

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Plugin do
  @callback name() :: String.t()
  @callback execute(input :: any(), opts :: keyword()) :: {:ok, any()} | {:error, any()}
  @callback supported_types() :: [atom()]
end

defmodule RubberDuck.PluginManager do
  use GenServer
  
  def register_plugin(plugin_module) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:register, plugin_module})
  end
  
  def execute_plugin(plugin_name, input, opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:execute, plugin_name, input, opts})
  end
end
```

### Protocol-based extensibility

Protocols provide a flexible way to extend functionality for different data types:

```elixir
defprotocol RubberDuck.Processor do
  def process(data, opts \\ [])
end

defimpl RubberDuck.Processor, for: Map do
  def process(%{type: "code"} = data, opts) do
    RubberDuck.CodeProcessor.process(data, opts)
  end
  
  def process(%{type: "text"} = data, opts) do
    RubberDuck.TextProcessor.process(data, opts)
  end
end
```

## Composing techniques with Reactor DAGs

Reactor provides powerful workflow orchestration capabilities for composing multiple enhancement techniques into complex pipelines.

### Hybrid workflow architecture

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.EnhancedProcessing do
  use Reactor
  
  input :user_query
  input :context_data
  
  step :chain_of_thought do
    argument :query, input(:user_query)
    run &CoTProcessor.generate_reasoning/2
  end
  
  step :rag_retrieval do
    argument :query, result(:chain_of_thought)
    run &RAGRetriever.fetch_context/2
    async? true
  end
  
  step :self_correction do
    argument :reasoning, result(:chain_of_thought)
    argument :context, result(:rag_retrieval)
    run &SelfCorrector.validate_and_correct/2
  end
  
  step :final_generation do
    argument :corrected_input, result(:self_correction)
    run &Generator.produce_output/2
  end
end
```

### Dynamic workflow generation

Support for runtime workflow construction based on task complexity:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.DynamicWorkflowBuilder do
  def build_workflow(task_type, complexity_level) do
    reactor = Reactor.Builder.new()
    
    {:ok, reactor} = Reactor.Builder.add_step(reactor, :base_processing, BaseProcessor)
    
    reactor = case complexity_level do
      :simple -> reactor
      :medium -> add_cot_steps(reactor)
      :complex -> reactor |> add_cot_steps() |> add_rag_steps() |> add_self_correction()
    end
    
    reactor
  end
  
  defp add_cot_steps(reactor) do
    steps = [
      {:understand_requirements, UnderstandStep},
      {:identify_approach, ApproachStep},
      {:implement_solution, SolutionStep}
    ]
    
    Enum.reduce(steps, reactor, fn {name, module}, acc ->
      {:ok, new_reactor} = Reactor.Builder.add_step(acc, name, module)
      new_reactor
    end)
  end
end
```

## Implementation patterns for each technique

### RAG implementation in Elixir

The RAG pattern leverages Elixir's concurrent processing capabilities for efficient retrieval and generation:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.RAG.Pipeline do
  def process(query, opts \\ []) do
    with {:ok, embeddings} <- generate_embeddings(query),
         {:ok, documents} <- retrieve_documents(embeddings, opts[:top_k] || 5),
         {:ok, reranked} <- rerank_documents(documents, query),
         {:ok, context} <- prepare_context(reranked),
         {:ok, response} <- generate_with_context(query, context) do
      {:ok, response}
    end
  end
  
  defp retrieve_documents(embeddings, top_k) do
    Task.async_stream(
      VectorStore.partitions(),
      fn partition ->
        VectorStore.search(partition, embeddings, top_k)
      end,
      max_concurrency: System.schedulers_online()
    )
    |> Enum.reduce([], &merge_results/2)
    |> top_k_overall(top_k)
  end
end
```

### Iterative self-correction with feedback loops

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.SelfCorrection.Engine do
  def correct_iteratively(initial_response, max_iterations \\ 3) do
    Stream.iterate({initial_response, 0}, fn {response, iteration} ->
      case evaluate_response(response) do
        {:ok, _} -> {:halt, response}
        {:error, issues} when iteration < max_iterations ->
          corrected = apply_corrections(response, issues)
          {corrected, iteration + 1}
        _ -> {:halt, response}
      end
    end)
    |> Enum.take_while(fn
      {:halt, _} -> false
      _ -> true
    end)
    |> List.last()
    |> elem(0)
  end
end
```

### Agentic workflows using OTP patterns

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Agents.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor
  
  def start_link(opts) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  def init(_opts) do
    children = [
      {DynamicSupervisor, name: RubberDuck.Agents.DynamicSupervisor},
      {Registry, keys: :unique, name: RubberDuck.Agents.Registry},
      RubberDuck.Agents.Coordinator
    ]
    
    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end

defmodule RubberDuck.Agents.Coordinator do
  def coordinate_task(task, agent_specs) do
    agents = Enum.map(agent_specs, &start_agent/1)
    
    results = Task.async_stream(
      agents,
      fn agent -> 
        GenServer.call(agent, {:execute, task})
      end,
      max_concurrency: length(agents)
    )
    |> Enum.map(fn {:ok, result} -> result end)
    
    aggregate_results(results)
  end
end
```

## Maintaining separation of concerns

The architecture maintains clear boundaries between different system layers while enabling seamless integration.

### Engine-level responsibilities (Spark DSL)

**Engine level handles:**

- Core LLM operations and model inference
- Basic prompt processing and template management
- Resource management and connection pooling
- Engine-specific optimizations

### Workflow-level responsibilities (Reactor)

**Workflow level handles:**

- Complex multi-step orchestration
- Error handling and compensation
- State management across steps
- Dynamic workflow composition

### Integration patterns

```elixir
# Engine-level definition
defmodule RubberDuck.Engines.Enhanced do
  use RubberDuck.Engine.Base
  
  engine :enhanced_gpt do
    provider :openai
    model "gpt-4"
    
    enhancement :chain_of_thought do
      template :reasoning
      max_steps 5
    end
  end
end

# Workflow-level usage
defmodule RubberDuck.Workflows.CodeAnalysis do
  use Reactor
  
  step :analyze do
    argument :code, input(:code)
    argument :engine, RubberDuck.Engines.Enhanced
    run &analyze_with_cot/2
  end
end
```

## Testing and validation strategies

### Comprehensive testing framework

The testing strategy combines traditional unit testing with LLM-specific evaluation approaches:

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.EnhancementTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  
  describe "Chain-of-Thought effectiveness" do
    test "reasoning steps are logically consistent" do
      chain = RubberDuck.CoT.Chain.new()
      |> RubberDuck.CoT.Chain.add_step(:understand, "First, understand the problem")
      |> RubberDuck.CoT.Chain.add_step(:analyze, "Then, analyze the requirements")
      
      {:ok, result} = RubberDuck.CoT.Chain.execute(chain, %{problem: "test problem"})
      
      assert logical_consistency_score(result) > 0.8
    end
  end
  
  describe "RAG quality metrics" do
    test "retrieval precision meets threshold" do
      query = "How to implement GenServer in Elixir?"
      {:ok, documents} = RubberDuck.RAG.retrieve(query)
      
      precision = calculate_precision_at_k(documents, relevant_docs(), 5)
      assert precision > 0.7
    end
  end
end
```

### Property-based testing for robustness

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.PropertyTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use ExUnitProperties
  
  property "CoT maintains logical consistency under perturbations" do
    check all prompt <- string(:alphanumeric, min_length: 10) do
      original = RubberDuck.CoT.process(prompt)
      perturbed = RubberDuck.CoT.process(add_noise(prompt))
      
      assert semantic_similarity(original, perturbed) > 0.85
    end
  end
end
```

### Effectiveness measurement

```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Metrics do
  use GenServer
  
  def track_enhancement_effectiveness(technique, metrics) do
    :telemetry.execute(
      [:rubber_duck, :enhancement, technique],
      metrics,
      %{timestamp: System.system_time()}
    )
  end
  
  def measure_cot_effectiveness(response) do
    %{
      reasoning_quality: evaluate_reasoning_steps(response),
      answer_accuracy: evaluate_final_answer(response),
      logical_consistency: check_internal_consistency(response),
      step_coherence: measure_step_transitions(response)
    }
  end
end
```

## Practical implementation roadmap

### Phase 1: Chain-of-Thought foundation

1. Implement core CoT architecture with Spark DSL
2. Create multi-engine abstraction layer
3. Build conversation management with OTP
