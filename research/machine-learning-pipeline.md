# Phase 6: Machine Learning Pipeline - Planning Document

**Created:** 2025-08-09  
**Planner:** Feature Planning Agent  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** High  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  

## Problem Statement

The current RubberDuck system uses naive learning logic with simple averaging/counting mechanisms for pattern recognition and prediction. This approach lacks the sophistication and accuracy needed for effective AI-driven optimization and real-time model updates. The existing learning components in `/home/ducky/code/rubberduck/lib/rubber_duck/actions/core/update_entity/learner.ex` and `/home/ducky/code/rubberduck/lib/rubber_duck/actions/agent/learn.ex` provide basic pattern analysis but lack:

- **Proper ML Pipeline**: Current learning uses basic arithmetic and frequency analysis instead of mathematical models
- **Feature Engineering**: No systematic feature extraction and transformation for entities
- **Real-time Learning**: Learning happens post-hoc rather than continuously updating models
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Simple patterns instead of statistical learning with confidence intervals
- **Scalability**: Current approach doesn't scale with data volume or complexity

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ Basic telemetry infrastructure from Phase 5 for ML metrics tracking
- ✅ Learning pattern detection and outcome tracking
- ✅ Entity impact analysis and feedback processing
- ❌ No mathematical ML models or feature engineering
- ❌ No real-time model updates or online learning
- ❌ No proper optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- ❌ No JIT compilation for performance optimization

## Solution Overview

Replace the naive learning logic with a proper ML pipeline using Nx and EXLA, implementing online learning with adaptive learning rates and real-time model updates. This will leverage the Elixir ML ecosystem that has matured significantly in 2025.

### High-Level Approach

1. **ML Pipeline Architecture**: Use Nx.Serving for distributed model serving and Nx for tensor operations
2. **Feature Engineering**: Implement systematic feature extraction for all entity types
3. **Online Learning System**: Real-time model updates using SGD with adaptive learning rates
4. **JIT Compilation**: Use EXLA for GPU-accelerated computations and performance optimization  
5. **Model Persistence**: Store and version models with event sourcing integration
