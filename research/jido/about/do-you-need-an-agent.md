# Do You Need an Agent?

## Overview

This guide helps you evaluate whether your application would benefit from an agent-based architecture using Jido. We'll explore what agents are, when they're most valuable, and when simpler alternatives might be more appropriate.

## What Makes Something an Agent?

At its core, an agent is a software entity that can:

1. Observe its environment through sensors
2. Make decisions based on those observations
3. Take actions that affect its environment
4. Learn from the results of its actions (optional)

In Jido specifically, agents are systems where either Large Language Models (LLMs) or classical planning algorithms dynamically direct their own processes.

## When Agents Excel

### Complex Decision Making

- Multiple data sources need to be analyzed together
- Decisions require contextual understanding
- Actions need to adapt based on previous outcomes

Example:

```elixir
defmodule ContentModerationAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "content_moderator",
    actions: [
      AnalyzeText,
      AnalyzeImage,
      CheckPolicyCompliance,
      TakeModeratorAction
    ]

  # This agent excels because it needs to:
  # 1. Consider multiple types of content
  # 2. Apply context-specific policies
  # 3. Take appropriate actions based on violations
end
```

### Dynamic Workflows

- Process flow isn't fixed
- Steps depend on intermediate results
- Multiple paths to goal achievement

Example:

```elixir
defmodule CustomerSupportAgent do
  use Jido.Agent,
    name: "support_assistant",
    actions: [
      ClassifyTicket,
      SearchKnowledgeBase,
      EscalateToHuman,
      GenerateResponse
    ]

  # Workflow varies based on:
  # - Ticket complexity
  # - Available solutions
  # - Need for human intervention
end
```

### Autonomous Operation

- System needs to operate independently
- Real-time response to changing conditions
- Self-correction and recovery

## When You Don't Need an Agent

### Simple Linear Processes

If your workflow follows a fixed sequence of steps, consider a pipeline or GenServer:

```elixir
defmodule SimpleProcessor do
  use GenServer

  def process_data(data) do
    data
    |> validate()
    |> transform()
    |> store()
  end
end
```

### Basic CRUD Operations

Standard web applications with straightforward database operations rarely need agents:

```elixir
defmodule UserController do
  use MyApp.Web, :controller

  def create(conn, params) do
    # Simple user creation logic
    changeset = User.changeset(%User{}, params)
    case Repo.insert(changeset) do
      {:ok, user} -> json(conn, user)
      {:error, changeset} -> json(conn, %{errors: changeset})
    end
  end
end
```

### Static Business Rules

When decisions follow clear, unchanging rules:

```elixir
defmodule PricingCalculator do
  def calculate_price(base_price, customer_tier) do
    case customer_tier do
      :premium -> base_price * 0.9  # 10% discount
      :standard -> base_price
      :basic -> base_price * 1.1    # 10% markup
    end
  end
end
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Agent Costs

1. Development Complexity

   - More moving parts
   - Complex state management
   - Additional testing requirements

2. Operational Overhead

   - Higher computation needs
   - LLM API costs (if using)
   - Monitoring complexity

3. Maintenance Burden
   - More sophisticated debugging
   - Regular LLM prompt tuning
   - Complex failure modes

### Agent Benefits

1. Flexibility

   - Easily adapt to new requirements
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Scale complexity without rewrites

2. Intelligence

   - Natural language understanding
   - Complex pattern recognition
   - Learning from experience

3. Autonomy
   - Reduced human intervention
   - 24/7 operation capability
   - Self-healing potential

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. Complexity Assessment

   - Does your problem require dynamic decision-making?
   - Are there multiple valid approaches to solving it?
   - Do solutions need to adapt based on context?

2. Resource Evaluation

   - Can you afford LLM API costs?
   - Do you have expertise to maintain agent systems?
   - Is the development time investment justified?

3. Alternative Analysis
   - Could a simple script handle this?
   - Would a traditional web service suffice?
   - Is this actually a data pipeline problem?

## Getting Started

If you've decided an agent is right for you:

1. Start Small

   ```elixir
   defmodule MyFirstAgent do
     use Jido.Agent,
       name: "starter_agent",
       actions: [SimpleAction]

     # Begin with basic functionality
     # Add complexity incrementally
   end
   ```

2. Measure Success

   - Define clear metrics
   - Monitor agent performance
   - Track resource usage

3. Iterate Carefully
   - Add capabilities gradually
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document decision points

## Common Pitfalls

1. Over-engineering

   - Adding agents where simple code would suffice
   - Using LLMs for deterministic tasks
   - Creating complex architectures prematurely

2. Under-preparation

   - Insufficient error handling
   - Poor monitoring setup
   - Lack of fallback mechanisms

3. Misaligned Expectations
   - Expecting perfect decisions
   - Underestimating maintenance needs
   - Ignoring cost implications

## Conclusion

Agents are powerful tools when used appropriately. They excel at complex, dynamic tasks requiring autonomous decision-making. However, they come with costs and complexity that aren't always justified.

Before implementing an agent-based solution:

- Carefully evaluate your needs
- Consider simpler alternatives
- Plan for maintenance and scaling
- Start small and iterate

Remember: The best architecture is often the simplest one that meets your needs effectively.
