## Overview

This phase establishes the foundational autonomous agent architecture for the Rubber Duck Coding Assistant. We create specialized Jido agents for code analysis, refactoring, testing, and documentation generation, all communicating through CloudEvents signals. The system self-organizes through Skills composition and adapts behavior at runtime through Directives.
