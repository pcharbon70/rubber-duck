## 3.6 Tool Skills Architecture Benefits

### Pluggable Tool System
Each tool becomes a reusable Skill that can be shared:
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Skills.GitTool do
  use Jido.Skill,
    name: "git_tool",
    description: "Git operations with intelligent branching",
    signals: [
      input: ["tool.git.*"],
      output: ["tool.result.*", "tool.error.*"]
    ],
    config: [
      auto_commit: [type: :boolean, default: false],
      branch_strategy: [type: :atom, default: :feature]
    ]
end
```

### Tool Composition via Instructions
Compose complex tool workflows using Instructions:
```elixir
instructions = [
  %Instruction{
    action: AnalyzeCode,
    params: %{path: "lib/"},
    opts: [timeout: 30_000]
  },
  %Instruction{
    action: GenerateTests,
    params: %{coverage_target: 0.8}
  },
  %Instruction{
    action: RefactorCode,
    params: %{strategy: :extract_functions}
  }
]

{:ok, results} = Workflow.run_chain(instructions)
```

### Runtime Tool Management with Directives
Adapt tool behavior without restarts:
```elixir
# Add new tool capability
%Directive.RegisterAction{
  action_module: RubberDuck.Skills.DatabaseTool
}

# Adjust tool configuration
%Directive.Enqueue{
  action: :configure_tool,
  params: %{tool: :git, auto_commit: true}
}

# Disable problematic tool temporarily
%Directive.DeregisterAction{
  action_module: RubberDuck.Skills.NetworkTool
}
```
