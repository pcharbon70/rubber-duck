## Overview

Create intelligent budget management agents that autonomously monitor, optimize, and enforce token usage across organizational hierarchy. The system provides comprehensive cost control through predictive analytics, autonomous optimization, and hierarchical budget management where every financial decision is made by goal-driven agents that learn from usage patterns and continuously optimize spending efficiency.

### Agentic Budget Management Philosophy
- **Autonomous Cost Control**: Agents make budget decisions based on usage patterns and efficiency goals
- **Hierarchical Intelligence**: Budget agents coordinate across organization, team, and project levels
- **Predictive Optimization**: Cost patterns predict future needs and prevent budget overruns
- **Efficiency Learning**: Agents continuously learn which providers and models deliver best value
- **Dynamic Reallocation**: Budget automatically shifts between projects based on priority and usage
- **Cost-Quality Balance**: Agents optimize for both cost efficiency and output quality
