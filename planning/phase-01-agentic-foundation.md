## Overview

Replace traditional OTP patterns with autonomous Jido agents, creating a foundation where every component is a self-managing, goal-driven agent capable of autonomous decision-making and continuous learning. The system self-organizes and adapts without manual intervention.

This phase establishes the fundamental agentic architecture using Jido Skills, Instructions, and Directives. By packaging agent capabilities as reusable Skills and enabling runtime adaptation through Directives, we create a system that not only manages itself but continuously evolves and optimizes its behavior based on outcomes and experience.
