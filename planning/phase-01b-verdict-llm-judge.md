## Overview

Implement the Verdict framework's innovative LLM-as-a-judge system that achieves state-of-the-art evaluation performance through judge-time compute scaling rather than simply using larger models. This phase provides the foundational evaluation infrastructure that enables intelligent code quality assessment throughout the RubberDuck system, with sophisticated prompt engineering, multi-provider support, and hierarchical configuration management.

### Verdict Framework Philosophy
- **Judge-Time Compute Scaling**: Achieve better results through sophisticated evaluation pipelines rather than larger models
- **Modular Reasoning Units**: Compose verification, debate, and aggregation units into complex workflows
- **Progressive Evaluation**: Start with lightweight screening, escalate to detailed analysis when needed
- **Cost Optimization**: 60-80% cost reduction through intelligent model selection and caching
- **Quality-First**: Focus on evaluation reliability through systematic bias mitigation
- **Configuration-Driven**: Every aspect controllable through three-tier preference system
