## Overview

Integrate a comprehensive web interface directly into the RubberDuck backend, providing a collaborative coding platform that combines agent-powered assistance with multi-user real-time collaboration. This phase consolidates the web client functionality into the backend system, enabling direct integration with the autonomous agents while providing a rich user experience through Phoenix LiveView, Monaco Editor, and real-time collaboration features.

### Integration Philosophy
- **Direct Agent Access**: Web interface directly communicates with backend agents without intermediate layers
- **Unified Architecture**: Single codebase combining backend intelligence with frontend interactivity  
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with agent participation as an intelligent collaborator
- **Seamless Experience**: Agents appear as natural participants in the coding environment
- **Performance Optimization**: Eliminate network overhead between separate client and server
- **Holistic Platform**: Complete development environment with integrated agent assistance
