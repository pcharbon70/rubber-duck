## Overview

The GEPA (Genetic Evolution of Prompts and Analyses) Engine represents a revolutionary approach to autonomous prompt optimization through genetic algorithms combined with reflective learning. Unlike traditional static prompting systems, GEPA continuously evolves prompts based on outcomes, maintains Pareto-optimal populations for multi-objective optimization, and employs sophisticated reflection mechanisms to extract insights from execution traces.

This phase creates an autonomous system that not only improves prompts over time but develops deep understanding of what makes effective prompts through pattern recognition, failure analysis, and success factor identification. The GEPA engine transforms prompt engineering from manual craft to autonomous science, enabling unprecedented accuracy in code generation and analysis tasks.
