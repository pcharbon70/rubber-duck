## Overview

The Pattern Detection Revolution transforms RubberDuck into the world's most comprehensive Elixir pattern intelligence platform, incorporating complete domain expertise through 47 total recognized patterns: 23 community-identified code smells and 24 official Elixir anti-patterns. By leveraging the revolutionary hybrid Nx-GEPA system, this phase achieves unprecedented detection accuracy while pioneering prevention-focused code generation.

This revolution goes beyond simple pattern matching to create deep understanding of why patterns are problematic, when they are acceptable, and how to prevent their introduction. The system becomes an educational AI platform that teaches both the patterns themselves and the underlying principles that make them problematic, transforming developers' understanding of Elixir best practices.
