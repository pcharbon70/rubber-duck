## Overview

Implement a comprehensive multi-agent system that autonomously detects 35+ documented code smells specific to Elixir codebases, analyzes their severity and impact, and orchestrates appropriate remediation through integration with Phase 14's refactoring agents. The system employs AST-based pattern detection, Ash framework persistence for tracking smell evolution, and Jido's autonomous agent architecture for intelligent coordination between detection, analysis, and remediation workflows.

### Code Smell Detection Philosophy
- **Proactive Quality Monitoring**: Agents continuously scan for emerging code smells
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Each smell evaluated within broader codebase context
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Severity calculated based on impact and propagation risk
- **Automated Remediation**: Direct integration with refactoring agents for fixes
- **Learning Detection**: Agents improve detection patterns from false positives/negatives
- **Team-Specific Adaptation**: System learns team preferences and coding patterns
