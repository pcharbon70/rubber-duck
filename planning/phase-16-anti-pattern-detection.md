## Overview

Implement a comprehensive system of 24+ specialized Jido agents that autonomously detect and refactor Elixir-specific anti-patterns, focusing on problematic code patterns that violate language idioms, OTP best practices, and functional programming principles. Each anti-pattern has a dedicated agent with specific detection rules, refactoring strategies, and coordinated execution through an orchestrator agent, providing targeted improvements to Elixir codebases beyond general code quality concerns.

### Anti-Pattern Detection Philosophy
- **Language-Specific Focus**: Target Elixir and OTP-specific problematic patterns
- **Prescriptive Refactoring**: Each detection includes concrete refactoring steps
- **Process-Aware Analysis**: Understand concurrency and process patterns
- **Macro Hygiene**: Detect and fix macro-related anti-patterns
- **Performance-Conscious**: Address patterns that impact runtime performance
- **Idiomatic Transformation**: Convert non-idiomatic code to Elixir best practices

## Phase Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 1: Agentic foundation with Jido framework
- Phase 3: Tool agent system for code execution
- Phase 4: Multi-agent planning for orchestration
- Phase 5: Memory system for learning and adaptation
- Phase 14: Refactoring agents for transformation capabilities
- Phase 15: Code smell detection for complementary analysis

**Integration Points:**
- Direct integration with Jido agent framework for all anti-pattern agents
- Ash persistence layer for anti-pattern tracking and history
- Coordination with Phase 14 refactoring agents
- Learning integration with Phase 5 memory management
- Real-time updates through Phase 13 web interface
- Orchestration through Phase 4 planning system

**Key Outputs:**
- 24+ specialized anti-pattern detection and refactoring agents
- Comprehensive Elixir and OTP anti-pattern coverage
- Intelligent orchestration and coordination system
- Safe, validated, and reversible refactoring execution
- Learning and adaptation mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Seamless integration with development workflows

**System Enhancement**: Phase 16 completes the intelligent code quality ecosystem by providing specialized detection and refactoring of Elixir-specific anti-patterns, working in harmony with Phase 14's general refactoring capabilities and Phase 15's code smell detection to create a comprehensive, learning-enabled system that continuously improves Elixir codebases by eliminating problematic patterns and promoting idiomatic, performant, and maintainable code.
