## 2.8 Provider Skills Architecture Benefits

### Pluggable Provider System
With Skills, adding new LLM providers becomes trivial:
```elixir
# Adding a new provider is just creating a new Skill
defmodule RubberDuck.Skills.GeminiProvider do
  use Jido.Skill,
    name: "gemini_provider",
    signals: [
      input: ["llm.request.gemini.*"],
      output: ["llm.response.*"]
    ]
end
```

### Runtime Provider Management
Use Directives to manage providers without restarts:
```elixir
# Hot-swap providers
%Directive.RegisterAction{
  action_module: NewProviderSkill
}

# Adjust provider configuration
%Directive.Enqueue{
  action: :update_provider_config,
  params: %{provider: :openai, temperature: 0.7}
}
```

## Phase Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 1: Agentic Foundation & Core Infrastructure completed (with Skills Registry)

- Vector database setup (PGVector or Chroma)
- Understanding of RAG architecture patterns
- Jido Skills, Instructions, and Directives patterns

**Provides Foundation For:**
- Phase 3: Tool agents that use LLM orchestration Skills
- Phase 4: Planning agents that compose Instructions with AI techniques
- Phase 5: Memory agents that utilize RAG Skills for context management
- Phase 7: Conversation agents that use streaming response Skills

**Key Outputs:**
- Autonomous LLM provider management with pluggable Skills
- Provider Skills for OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models
- Self-optimizing RAG pipeline with composable retrieval Skills
- Intelligent routing Skills for load balancing and failover
- Advanced AI technique Skills (CoT, self-correction, few-shot)
- Runtime provider management through Directives
- Streaming response infrastructure with real-time processing

**Next Phase**: [Phase 3: Intelligent Tool Agent System](phase-03-tool-agents.md) builds upon this LLM orchestration to create autonomous tool discovery and execution agents.
