## Overview

This phase establishes the revolutionary Nx tensor infrastructure that forms the mathematical foundation for the hybrid ML system. By implementing comprehensive tensor operations, distributed model serving, and robust fallback mechanisms, we create a production-ready foundation that operates seamlessly across diverse deployment environments - from high-performance GPU clusters to resource-constrained systems.

The Nx Foundation provides the mathematical backbone for advanced code analysis through tensor-based embeddings, similarity computations, and neural network operations. This infrastructure enables unprecedented precision in code understanding while maintaining the system's reliability through intelligent degradation strategies when ML dependencies are unavailable.
