## 12.10 Advanced Analysis Skills Architecture

### Composable Analysis System
Each analyzer becomes a reusable Skill that can be composed:
```elixir
defmodule RubberDuck.Skills.DependencyAnalysisSkill do
  use Jido.Skill,
    name: "dependency_analysis",
    description: "Comprehensive dependency analysis and decoupling",
    signals: [
      input: ["code.analyze.dependencies", "code.check.coupling"],
      output: ["analysis.dependencies.*", "analysis.suggestions.decoupling"]
    ],
    config: [
      depth_limit: [type: :integer, default: 5],
      include_external: [type: :boolean, default: false]
    ]
end
```

### Analysis Composition via Instructions
Compose complex analysis workflows using Instructions:
```elixir
instructions = [
  %Instruction{
    action: AnalyzeDependencies,
    params: %{path: "lib/", detect_cycles: true}
  },
  %Instruction{
    action: TrackComplexityTrends,
    params: %{timeframe: :last_30_days}
  },
  %Instruction{
    action: ValidateArchitecture,
    params: %{rules: :ddd_boundaries}
  }
]

{:ok, analysis_results} = Workflow.run_chain(instructions)
```

### Runtime Analysis Management with Directives
Adapt analysis behavior without restarts:
```elixir
# Enable new analyzer
%Directive.RegisterAction{
  action_module: RubberDuck.Analyzers.DependencyAnalyzer
}

# Adjust analysis configuration
%Directive.Enqueue{
  action: :configure_analyzer,
  params: %{analyzer: :complexity_trends, threshold: 10}
}

# Disable problematic analyzer temporarily
%Directive.DeregisterAction{
  action_module: RubberDuck.Analyzers.SecurityScanner
}
```
